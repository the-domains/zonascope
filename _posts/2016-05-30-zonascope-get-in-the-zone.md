# Zonascope: Get in The Zone

## An App to know your brain's best times

Have you ever wondered when in the day you are most productive or when is the best time to sit down and do some study? Or lets say you have a problem, wouldn't you like to know when your problem solving abilities are going to be peaking so that you can use your other time to do one of your other millions things you have to get done. 

Now there is a way to track and determine when you are going to most productive in a day. ZONASCOPE is a new app for iPhone that lets you play brain training games and then uses those scores to build a personal productivity profile of when you are most during the day. ZONASCOPE works out the best time to get you into _THE ZONE_ of optimal performance.

## ZONASCOPE's Mechanics

There are four different games that measure memory, attention, processing speed and problem solving. Each time you finish a game, your score and time is logged along with some additional behavioral data (such as mood and energy). ZONASCOPE then determines what times you are operating best for the different cognitive components. 

That means that you may have a meeting and need to be taking in a lot of information and so you would like to know when your processing speed is working its fastest so that you can schedule the meeting for that time. Simply open up _THE ZONE_ profile page and you will be able to determine when your processing speed is the fastest.

If you've ever wanted to get into _THE ZONE_ the ZONASCOPE app will help you get there by letting you know your best performance times. Get more done in your day, be more productive, and have more leisure time when you know when you are at your best!

## The Science of ZONASCOPE

ZONASCOPE focuses on cyclic performance factors and how they influence cognitive output. What that means is how our productivity changes throughout the day. The interest in cyclic performance fluctuations is not novel. Studies from the early 20th Century focused on the determination of the most favorable time of day for teaching in order to optimize school timetables. 

What has been found is that our homoestatic and circadian rhythms play a major role in our performance output. Apart from the major factors of wakefulness and core temperature, motivation, stress, food, exercise and caffeine are just a few of the additional factors that can contribute to cognitive performance changes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f48904d5-b914-4be1-bbb9-c1fddfe49886.jpg)

What is interesting is that these influences don't simply relate to general cognitive output but different parts of cognition are affected in different ways throughout the day. For example, memory might be peaking when your problem solving abilities might be waning.

By knowing when your hormonal cycles are peaking or dropping out doesn't translate as directly as when your performance levels are peaking. ZONASCOPE allows you to track different data points so that you can determine where these different cognitive components are for your overall performance.
